# spotted_playlist_tracks (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
data "spotted_playlist_tracks" "example_playlist_tracks" {
  playlist_id = "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n"
  additional_types = "additional_types"
  fields = "items(added_by.id,track(name,href,album(name,href)))"
  market = "ES"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `playlist_id` (String) The [Spotify ID](/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) of the playlist.

### Optional

- `additional_types` (String) A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the default `track` type. Valid types are: `track` and `episode`.<br/>
_**Note**: This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future._<br/>
In addition to providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of new types in the future by checking against the `type` field of each object.
- `fields` (String) Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the
fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get
just the total number of items and the request limit:<br/>`fields=total,limit`<br/>A
dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses
can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to
get just the added date and user ID of the adder:<br/>`fields=items(added_at,added_by.id)`<br/>Use
multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example:<br/>`fields=items(track(name,href,album(name,href)))`<br/>Fields
can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example:<br/>`fields=items.track.album(!external_urls,images)`
- `limit` (Number) The maximum number of items to return. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.
- `market` (String) An [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
  If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.<br/>
  If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with
  the user account will take priority over this parameter.<br/>
  _**Note**: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client._<br/>
  Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the [account settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/overview/).
- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000
- `offset` (Number) The index of the first item to return. Default: 0 (the first item). Use with limit to get the next set of items.
