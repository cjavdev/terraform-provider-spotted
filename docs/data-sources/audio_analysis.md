## Example Usage

```terraform
data "spotted_audio_analysis" "example_audio_analysis" {
  id = "11dFghVXANMlKmJXsNCbNl"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The [Spotify ID](/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids)
for the track.

### Read-Only

- `bars` (Attributes List) The time intervals of the bars throughout the track. A bar (or measure) is a segment of time defined as a given number of beats. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--bars))
- `beats` (Attributes List) The time intervals of beats throughout the track. A beat is the basic time unit of a piece of music; for example, each tick of a metronome. Beats are typically multiples of tatums. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--beats))
- `meta` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--meta))
- `published` (Boolean) The playlist's public/private status (if it should be added to the user's profile or not): `true` the playlist will be public, `false` the playlist will be private, `null` the playlist status is not relevant. For more about public/private status, see [Working with Playlists](/documentation/web-api/concepts/playlists)
- `sections` (Attributes List) Sections are defined by large variations in rhythm or timbre, e.g. chorus, verse, bridge, guitar solo, etc. Each section contains its own descriptions of tempo, key, mode, time_signature, and loudness. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sections))
- `segments` (Attributes List) Each segment contains a roughly conisistent sound throughout its duration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segments))
- `tatums` (Attributes List) A tatum represents the lowest regular pulse train that a listener intuitively infers from the timing of perceived musical events (segments). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tatums))
- `track` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--track))

<a id="nestedatt--sections"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sections`

Read-Only:

- `confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the section's "designation".
- `duration` (Number) The duration (in seconds) of the section.
- `key` (Number) The estimated overall key of the section. The values in this field ranging from 0 to 11 mapping to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation (E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on). If no key was detected, the value is -1.
- `key_confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the key. Songs with many key changes may correspond to low values in this field.
- `loudness` (Number) The overall loudness of the section in decibels (dB). Loudness values are useful for comparing relative loudness of sections within tracks.
- `mode` (Number) Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a section, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. This field will contain a 0 for "minor", a 1 for "major", or a -1 for no result. Note that the major key (e.g. C major) could more likely be confused with the minor key at 3 semitones lower (e.g. A minor) as both keys carry the same pitches.
Available values: -1, 0, 1.
- `mode_confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `mode`.
- `published` (Boolean) The playlist's public/private status (if it should be added to the user's profile or not): `true` the playlist will be public, `false` the playlist will be private, `null` the playlist status is not relevant. For more about public/private status, see [Working with Playlists](/documentation/web-api/concepts/playlists)
- `start` (Number) The starting point (in seconds) of the section.
- `tempo` (Number) The overall estimated tempo of the section in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
- `tempo_confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the tempo. Some tracks contain tempo changes or sounds which don't contain tempo (like pure speech) which would correspond to a low value in this field.
- `time_signature` (Number) An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4".
- `time_signature_confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `time_signature`. Sections with time signature changes may correspond to low values in this field.


<a id="nestedatt--segments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segments`

Read-Only:

- `confidence` (Number) The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the segmentation. Segments of the song which are difficult to logically segment (e.g: noise) may correspond to low values in this field.
- `duration` (Number) The duration (in seconds) of the segment.
- `loudness_end` (Number) The offset loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). This value should be equivalent to the loudness_start of the following segment.
- `loudness_max` (Number) The peak loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). Combined with `loudness_start` and `loudness_max_time`, these components can be used to describe the "attack" of the segment.
- `loudness_max_time` (Number) The segment-relative offset of the segment peak loudness in seconds. Combined with `loudness_start` and `loudness_max`, these components can be used to desctibe the "attack" of the segment.
- `loudness_start` (Number) The onset loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). Combined with `loudness_max` and `loudness_max_time`, these components can be used to describe the "attack" of the segment.
- `pitches` (List of Number) Pitch content is given by a “chroma” vector, corresponding to the 12 pitch classes C, C#, D to B, with values ranging from 0 to 1 that describe the relative dominance of every pitch in the chromatic scale. For example a C Major chord would likely be represented by large values of C, E and G (i.e. classes 0, 4, and 7).

Vectors are normalized to 1 by their strongest dimension, therefore noisy sounds are likely represented by values that are all close to 1, while pure tones are described by one value at 1 (the pitch) and others near 0.
As can be seen below, the 12 vector indices are a combination of low-power spectrum values at their respective pitch frequencies.
![pitch vector](/assets/audio/Pitch_vector.png)
- `published` (Boolean) The playlist's public/private status (if it should be added to the user's profile or not): `true` the playlist will be public, `false` the playlist will be private, `null` the playlist status is not relevant. For more about public/private status, see [Working with Playlists](/documentation/web-api/concepts/playlists)
- `start` (Number) The starting point (in seconds) of the segment.
- `timbre` (List of Number) Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex notion also referred to as sound color, texture, or tone quality, and is derived from the shape of a segment’s spectro-temporal surface, independently of pitch and loudness. The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.

For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
![timbre basis functions](/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png)

The actual timbre of the segment is best described as a linear combination of these 12 basis functions weighted by the coefficient values: timbre = c1 x b1 + c2 x b2 + ... + c12 x b12, where c1 to c12 represent the 12 coefficients and b1 to b12 the 12 basis functions as displayed below. Timbre vectors are best used in comparison with each other.
