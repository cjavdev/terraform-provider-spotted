## Schema

### Optional

- `market` (String) An [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
  If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.<br/>
  If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with
  the user account will take priority over this parameter.<br/>
  _**Note**: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client._<br/>
  Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the [account settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/overview/).
- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000
- `offset` (Number) The index of the first item to return. Default: 0 (the first item). Use with limit to get the next set of items.

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) The items returned by the data source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `added_at` (String) The date and time the track was saved.
Timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) with a zero offset: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
If the time is imprecise (for example, the date/time of an album release), an additional field indicates the precision; see for example, release_date in an album object.
- `track` (Attributes) Information about the track. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track))

<a id="nestedatt--items--track"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.track`

Read-Only:

- `album` (Attributes) The album on which the track appears. The album object includes a link in `href` to full information about the album. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--album))
- `artists` (Attributes List) The artists who performed the track. Each artist object includes a link in `href` to more detailed information about the artist. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--artists))
- `available_markets` (List of String) A list of the countries in which the track can be played, identified by their [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code.
- `disc_number` (Number) The disc number (usually `1` unless the album consists of more than one disc).
- `duration_ms` (Number) The track length in milliseconds.
- `explicit` (Boolean) Whether or not the track has explicit lyrics ( `true` = yes it does; `false` = no it does not OR unknown).
- `external_ids` (Attributes) Known external IDs for the track. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--external_ids))
- `external_urls` (Attributes) Known external URLs for this track. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--external_urls))
- `href` (String) A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.
- `id` (String) The [Spotify ID](/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) for the track.
- `is_local` (Boolean) Whether or not the track is from a local file.
- `is_playable` (Boolean) Part of the response when [Track Relinking](/documentation/web-api/concepts/track-relinking) is applied. If `true`, the track is playable in the given market. Otherwise `false`.
- `linked_from` (Attributes) Part of the response when [Track Relinking](/documentation/web-api/concepts/track-relinking) is applied, and the requested track has been replaced with different track. The track in the `linked_from` object contains information about the originally requested track. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--linked_from))
- `name` (String) The name of the track.
- `popularity` (Number) The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.<br/>The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.<br/>Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. _**Note**: the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time._
- `preview_url` (String, Deprecated) A link to a 30 second preview (MP3 format) of the track. Can be `null`
- `restrictions` (Attributes) Included in the response when a content restriction is applied. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--track--restrictions))
